# Digit-Recognizer
MNIST Dataset

This is a implementation of [this](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer) competition in the Kaggle.

Python Folder:
Same implementation done with two libraries Tensorflow and Keras using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). Both models are 97-98% accurate.
Libraries:  
`pip install pandas`
`pip install numpy`
`pip install os`
`pip install matplotlib`
`pip install tensorflow`
`pip install tflearn`
`pip install keras`

Javascript Folder:
In order to start the model working you should be in the same directory as mdel.json file. Run `http://127.0.0.1:8080` in your terminal. I your localhost server os not `http://127.0.0.1:8080` then replace your server in digit_recognizer.js.
Libraries:  
`p5.js`
`tensorflow.js`
